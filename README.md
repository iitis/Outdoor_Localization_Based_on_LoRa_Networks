# Device Localization Based on RSSI in LoRa Networks
This study presents a machine learning-based device localization approach in an outdoor environment utilizing LoRa networks and RSSI.

*Dataset*

In this study, we use the latest version of the open-source LoraWAN data set called "Sigfox and LoRaWAN datasets for fingerprint localization in large urban and rural areas."

The data set containing around $130,000$ LoRaWAN messages was collected in Antwerp, Belgium. In the dataset, there are 77 features in each message (each sample), including $72$ RSSI values, RX Time, SF, HDOP, Latitude, and Longitude.
